<h1>Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa</h1>

<hr />

<h4>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h4>

<p>The most widespread epidemic of <strong>Ebola virus disease</strong> (commonly known as
  "Ebola") in history began in Guinea on December 2013 and continued with
  significant loss of life for over two years until being declared over in
  January 2016, though the World Health Organization warns that small outbreaks
   may continue to be reported.[11] The epidemic was centred in the West African
    nations of Liberia, Guinea and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone">Sierra Leone</a>, with minor outbreaks elsewhere.
     It has caused significant mortality, with reported case fatality rates of
     up to 70%[12][13][14][note 1] and specifically 57â€“59% among hospitalized
     patients.[15] Ebola virus disease was first described in 1976 in two
     simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Democratic Republic of the
     Congo; this is the first Ebola outbreak to occur in the West African
     subcontinent. The outbreak began in Guinea in December 2013 and then
     spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone.[12] Small outbreaks occurred in
     Nigeria and Mali,[6][16] and isolated cases occurred in Senegal,[17]
     the United Kingdom and Sardinia.[14] Imported cases in the United States
     and Spain led to secondary infections of medical workers but did not
     spread further.[18][19] As of 14 January 2016, the World Health
     Organization (WHO) and respective governments have reported a total of
     28,638 suspected cases and 11,315 deaths,[2] though the WHO believes that
     this substantially understates the magnitude of the outbreak.[20][21]
     The WHO has warned that further small outbreaks of the disease may occur
     in the future, and vigilance should be maintained.[22]
